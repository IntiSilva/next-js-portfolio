The core prioritizes time consistency with timezone-aware logic for agenda and 'today/upcoming' ordering, using derived local date keys to sort correctly in the viewer's timezone. It includes RSVP flows with uniqueness rules and reminder preference synchronization, plus cron-driven email delivery using React Email templates. For UX and performance, it combines Motion One micro-interactions, tilt/3D cards, and WebGL backgrounds with fallbacks that honor 'prefers-reduced-motion'. The project is backed by a complete unit/integration + E2E test stack (Vitest + Playwright) to keep critical flows regression-safe."
